🔍 ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS
─────────────────────
**ROOT CAUSE:** `ts-admin-route-service` is failing during `AdminRouteController.addRoute` via a POST request. The failure is due to a `HttpMessageNotReadableException` stemming from a JSON parsing error – specifically, attempting to deserialize an `ArrayList<java.lang.Object>` from a JSON string received as the `distances` field of a `RouteInfo` object.

**FIX:** Investigate the JSON payload being sent in the POST request to `AdminRouteController.addRoute`.  The payload is incorrectly structured and attempting to serialize a generic `ArrayList` as a string.  The `distances` field within `RouteInfo` should contain a properly formatted JSON array of numerical values (e.g., `[1.2, 3.4, 5.6]`).
